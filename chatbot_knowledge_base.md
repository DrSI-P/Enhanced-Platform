## 2. Key Concepts from Dr. Patrick's Expertise (Derived from Thesis & Manuscript)

**(This section will be populated by summarising key principles and advice from Dr. Patrick's doctoral thesis and manuscript. Focus on actionable insights and UK context.)**

*   **Restorative Justice Practices in Education:**
    *   **Core Principle:** Focuses on repairing harm and building relationships, rather than solely on punishment. It seeks to understand the underlying causes of behaviour and involve all affected parties in finding a resolution.
    *   **Application:** Can be used to address conflict, bullying, and challenging behaviour in schools, fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment.
    *   **Key Insight (from thesis):** (Placeholder: e.g., "Restorative approaches lead to more sustainable behavioural changes and improved school climate compared to zero-tolerance policies.")
*   **Emotionally Based School Avoidance (EBSA):
    *   **Definition:** EBSA refers to significant difficulty in attending school due to emotional factors, often manifesting as anxiety, fear, or distress related to the school environment.
    *   **Underlying Causes:** Commonly linked to anxiety disorders, depression, sensory sensitivities, bullying, academic pressures, or difficulties with social interaction. It is distinct from truancy where the child is typically not emotionally distressed about non-attendance.
    *   **Support Strategies:** Requires a multi-faceted approach involving collaboration between home, school, and potentially external professionals. Key elements include understanding the child's specific anxieties, gradual re-integration plans, and creating a supportive school environment.
    *   **Key Insight (from thesis):** (Placeholder: e.g., "Early identification and a compassionate, child-centred approach are critical for successful intervention in EBSA cases.")
*   **Inclusive Education & Equity:**
    *   **Core Principle:** Ensuring all children and young people, regardless of their background, abilities, or needs (including SEND), have equitable access to high-quality education and support to reach their full potential.
    *   **Key Insight (from thesis):** (Placeholder: e.g., "True inclusion goes beyond physical presence in mainstream schools; it requires systemic changes in pedagogy, curriculum, and school culture to meet diverse learning needs.")

## 3. Curated FAQs (UK Educational Psychology Focus)

**(Initial list of ~20-30 FAQs. To be expanded.)**

**EHCNA & EHCPs:**
1.  **Q: What is an EHCNA in the UK?**
    A: An Education, Health and Care Needs Assessment (EHCNA) is a formal assessment conducted by a Local Authority in the UK to determine if a child or young person (up to age 25) requires an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) to meet their special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).
2.  **Q: Who can request an EHCNA?**
    A: A parent, a young person over 16, or the school/educational setting can request an EHCNA from the Local Authority. Other professionals (like doctors or health visitors) can also bring a child or young person to the LAâ€™s attention.
3.  **Q: What is an EHCP?**
    A: An Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) is a legal document in the UK that outlines a child or young person's special educational, health, and social care needs and the provision required to meet those needs. It is for those with significant and complex SEND.
4.  **Q: How long does an EHCNA process take?**
    A: The entire process from requesting an EHCNA to the final EHCP being issued (if one is agreed) should take no more than 20 weeks, according to statutory guidelines, although there can be local variations and delays.
5.  **Q: What should be included in an EHCP?**
    A: An EHCP has specific sections including: the views, interests and aspirations of the child and their parents; special educational needs (SEN); health needs related to SEN; social care needs related to SEN; outcomes sought; special educational provision; health provision; social care provision; and placement.

**Emotionally Based School Avoidance (EBSA):**
6.  **Q: My child is refusing to go to school due to anxiety. Is this EBSA?**
    A: It could be. EBSA is characterized by significant difficulty attending school due to emotional distress, often anxiety-related. It's important to explore the underlying reasons with your child and school. If you are concerned, speak to the school's SENCo or pastoral lead, or your GP.
7.  **Q: How can I support my child with EBSA?**
    A: Listen to your child's concerns, work collaboratively with the school, establish a predictable routine, seek professional advice (e.g., from an Educational Psychologist or CAMHS if appropriate), and focus on small, manageable steps towards returning to school if that is the goal.
8.  **Q: What is the school's role in supporting EBSA?**
    A: Schools should work with families to understand the reasons for EBSA, provide a supportive and flexible environment, develop a tailored plan for re-engagement (which might be gradual), and make reasonable adjustments. They should also address any in-school factors like bullying or unmet learning needs.

**General Educational Psychology:**
9.  **Q: What does an Educational Psychologist (EP) do?**
    A: Educational Psychologists in the UK apply psychological theory and research to promote the learning, development, and well-being of children and young people. They work with individuals, families, schools, and local authorities, conducting assessments, providing interventions, offering training, and contributing to policy.
10. **Q: When should I consider consulting an Educational Psychologist?**
    A: You might consider consulting an EP if your child is experiencing significant difficulties with learning, attention, behaviour, social interaction, or emotional well-being that are impacting their education, and school-based support has not fully addressed these concerns.
11. **Q: What is dyslexia?**
    A: Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. It is characterized by difficulties in phonological awareness, verbal memory, and verbal processing speed. It occurs across the range of intellectual abilities.
12. **Q: How can I support a child with dyslexia?**
    A: Support can include multi-sensory teaching approaches, phonics-based interventions, assistive technology, providing extra time for tasks, and focusing on the child's strengths. A formal assessment can help identify specific areas of need.
13. **Q: What is ADHD?**
    A: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent patterns of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that interfere with functioning or development. 
14. **Q: How is ADHD supported in UK schools?**
    A: Support can include classroom strategies (e.g., clear routines, movement breaks, minimizing distractions), behavioural interventions, and sometimes medication prescribed by a specialist. An EHCP may be needed for significant needs.
15. **Q: What are executive functioning skills?**
    A: Executive functions are a set of mental skills that include working memory, flexible thinking, and self-control. They help us plan, focus attention, remember instructions, and juggle multiple tasks. Difficulties in this area are common in conditions like ADHD and Autism.
