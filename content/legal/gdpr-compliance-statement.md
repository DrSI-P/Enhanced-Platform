**Last Updated: May 14, 2025**

## 1. Our Commitment to GDPR

EdPsych Connect Limited ("EdPsych Connect", "we", "us", or "our") is fully committed to upholding the principles of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Data Protection Act 2018. We recognise the importance of protecting the personal data of our users (including children, parents, and educators) and are dedicated to processing it responsibly, transparently, and securely.

This statement outlines our approach to GDPR compliance and should be read in conjunction with our comprehensive [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and [Cookie Policy](/cookies), which provide detailed information on how we collect, use, store, and protect your personal data.

## 2. GDPR Principles We Follow

EdPsych Connect adheres to the core principles of data protection as set out in the UK GDPR. These principles guide all our data processing activities:

*   **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency:** We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. We provide clear information about our data processing activities through our Privacy Policy and other relevant notices.
*   **Purpose Limitation:** We collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and do not process it in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.
*   **Data Minimisation:** We ensure that personal data we collect is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.
*   **Accuracy:** We take reasonable steps to ensure that personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. We provide mechanisms for users to correct their information.
*   **Storage Limitation:** We keep personal data in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed.
*   **Integrity and Confidentiality (Security):** We process personal data in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical and organisational measures.
*   **Accountability:** We are responsible for, and able to demonstrate compliance with, the GDPR principles. This includes maintaining records of our processing activities, conducting data protection impact assessments where required, and implementing appropriate data protection policies.

## 3. Your Rights Under UK GDPR

As a data subject under UK GDPR, you have several important rights concerning your personal data. EdPsych Connect is committed to facilitating the exercise of these rights. These include:

*   **The right to be informed:** About how your personal data is being used (which is the purpose of our Privacy Policy).
*   **The right of access:** To obtain a copy of your personal data.
*   **The right to rectification:** To have inaccurate personal data corrected.
*   **The right to erasure (the 

right to be forgotten

):** To have your personal data deleted in certain circumstances.
*   **The right to restrict processing:** To limit how we use your personal data in certain circumstances.
*   **The right to data portability:** To receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to have it transmitted to another controller where technically feasible.
*   **The right to object:** To the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances (e.g., for direct marketing or processing based on legitimate interests).
*   **Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling:** To not be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, without human intervention or other safeguards.

For detailed information on these rights and how to exercise them, please refer to Section 8 of our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## 5. Data Transfers

If EdPsych Connect transfers personal data outside of the United Kingdom (UK), we ensure that such transfers are lawful and that your data remains protected to the standards required by UK GDPR. This is achieved through mechanisms such as UK Adequacy Regulations (where the recipient country is deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection) or by implementing Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as approved by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), along with any necessary supplementary measures.

Further details on international data transfers can be found in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## 6. Data Security

We take data security very seriously and have implemented appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard the personal data we process. These measures are designed to prevent unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of your data. Our security practices are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they meet current standards and address emerging threats.
