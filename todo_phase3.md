# EdPsych Connect - Phase 3 Development Checklist

This checklist outlines the tasks for Phase 3, starting with the **Dynamic AI Learning Architect**.

## 1. Dynamic AI Learning Architect (DALA)

**1.1. Conceptualization and Design**
*   [X] **Task 1.1.1:** Outline core functionalities of the DALA, focusing on novel, evidence-based approaches to personalized learning.
*   [X] **Task 1.1.2:** Design user interaction flows for students and educators, detailing how they will interact with the DALA.
*   [X] **Task 1.1.3:** Define adaptive learning path algorithms and logic, including how the DALA will assess learning styles, pace, and understanding.
*   [X] **Task 1.1.4:** Specify data requirements, including input data (student interactions, assessment results, curriculum content) and output data (personalized learning plans, progress reports).
*   [X] **Task 1.1.5:** Outline the system architecture, including key components, AI models, and integrations.
*   [X] **Task 1.1.6:** Identify potential challenges (technical, ethical, pedagogical) and propose mitigation strategies..
*   [X] **Task 1.1.7:** Draft a comprehensive concept document for the DALA, incorporating all of the above.
*   [X] **Task 1.1.8:** Collect and incorporate user feedback on the DALA concept document.

**1.2. Prototyping and Development (Further tasks to be defined after conceptualization)**

## 2. AI Co-Planner for Differentiated Instruction (Further tasks to be defined)

## 3. Intelligent Assessment & Insight Generator (Further tasks to be defined)

## 4. Automated "Learning Gap" Detector & Intervention Strategist (Further tasks to be defined)

## 5. Proactive Well-being & Metacognitive Coach (Further tasks to be defined)

## 6. AI-Powered "Curiosity Engine" & Creative Collaboration Hub (Further tasks to be defined)



    *   [X] **Task 1.2.1: Environment Setup & Core Libraries Installation:** Set up development environment, install ML/NLP libraries, establish version control.
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.2: Develop Initial HLP - Learning Style & Interest Module (Simplified):** Design and implement 2-3 simple interactive diagnostic mini-tasks, capture initial student interests, create basic learner profile data structure.
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.3: Digitize a Small Curriculum Slice & Content Set:** Select small curriculum segment, prepare and tag 5-10 diverse learning content pieces, store metadata.
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.4: Develop Basic DCW-APG - Pathway Logic:** Implement rule-based/simple algorithmic approach for basic learning sequence generation based on HLP and curriculum slice, develop logic to select content based on preference.
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.5: Create a Simple Student Interface Prototype:** Develop basic web interface/script output for diagnostic tasks, interest selection, and display of learning sequence/content.
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.6: Initial Prototype Testing & Iteration:** Conduct internal testing with simulated profiles, gather initial feedback, refine HLP and DCW-APG logic, and enhance interface based on feedback (visuals, struggle capture).



**1.2.7: Develop Reward Mini-Game System (Gamification)**
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.7.1:** Outline concepts for 2-3 simple, engaging reward mini-games (e.g., quick puzzle, pattern matching, simple collector game).
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.7.2:** Develop the chosen mini-game(s) as simple, standalone HTML/JavaScript snippets or integrate into the Python-generated interface.
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.7.3:** Integrate logic to trigger mini-games as rewards after completing learning objectives or pathway segments..
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.7.4:** Validate mini-game functionality and integration within the DALA prototype..
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.7.5:** Collect user feedback on the mini-game concepts and implementation.



**1.2.8: Stage 1 - Documentation & Code Commit**
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.8.1:** Draft Stage 1 Prototype Documentation.
    *   [X] **Task 1.2.8.2:** Review and Edit Stage 1 Prototype Documentation.
    *   [ ] **Task 1.2.8.3:** Commit all code and documentation to GitHub.
